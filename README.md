## Key Insights
### Sales Trend by Year
Sales increased significantly from 2022 (3,255,970) to 2023 (3,786,592), indicating strong year-over-year growth. However, in 2024, sales slightly declined to 3,625,319, suggesting a potential slowdown after the peak in 2023. Despite this decrease, overall sales remain higher than in 2022, reflecting sustained business performance over the three-year period.

### Profit Performance by Region (2022–2024)
Across the three-year period, the West region consistently generated the highest profits, peaking in 2023 (176,199.93) and maintaining a similarly high level in 2024 (175,450.11), indicating strong and stable regional performance.

The South region also showed strong profitability, with a notable increase from 2022 (143,618.92) to 2023 (175,862.35), followed by a decline in 2024 (138,622.00), suggesting possible volatility or changing market conditions.

The North region experienced a significant profit increase in 2023 (161,174.38) compared to 2022 (130,057.85), but profits dropped in 2024 (135,082.52), indicating that the 2023 growth was not sustained.

In contrast, the East region remained relatively stable across all three years, with profits consistently around 155,000, reflecting steady but limited growth compared to other regions.

Focusing on sustaining performance in the West while addressing volatility in the South and North regions could help stabilize overall profitability. The East region may benefit from targeted strategies to unlock additional growth.

### Sales Performance by Category per Year
Electronics consistently generated the highest sales across all three years, increasing from 1,616,149 in 2022 to a peak of 1,881,367 in 2023, before experiencing a slight decline in 2024 (1,828,558). Despite the decrease, Electronics remained the leading revenue-driving category.

Accessories showed steady growth from 2022 (1,329,731) to 2023 (1,495,723), followed by a moderate decline in 2024 (1,422,137). This trend suggests strong demand in 2023 with a slight softening in the following year.

The Office category recorded the lowest sales across all years but demonstrated noticeable growth from 2022 (310,090) to 2023 (409,502), before declining to 374,624 in 2024, indicating potential for growth but with limited scale compared to other categories.

Maintaining focus on Electronics and Accessories while exploring expansion opportunities in the Office category could help diversify revenue and support long-term growth

### Top Products by Profit
The Camera generated the highest profit at 207,630.99, making it the most profitable product in the portfolio. This is closely followed by Monitor (202,028.17), indicating strong demand and healthy profit margins for both products.

Several products—including Mouse, Laptop, Printer, and Smartphone—show very similar profit levels, each contributing between 183,000 and 186,000, suggesting a balanced distribution of profitability among mid-tier products rather than reliance on a single item.

Lower within the top 10, products such as Keyboard, Headphones, and Tablet still generate substantial profits, highlighting a strong long-tail contribution to overall profitability.

Prioritizing inventory availability and marketing efforts for high-profit products like Cameras and Monitors could maximize returns, while maintaining a diverse product mix helps reduce revenue concentration risk.

## Quantity Sold by Product
Among Accessories, Monitor (1,876 units) recorded the highest quantity sold, followed by Mouse (1,753) and Keyboard (1,684), indicating strong and consistent demand for essential accessories.

Within the Electronics category, Smartwatch (1,807 units) and Camera (1,795 units) achieved the highest sales volume, suggesting strong customer interest in wearable and imaging devices. Other electronic products such as Tablet (1,733) and Laptop (1,658) also maintained healthy sales volumes.

In the Office category, Printer (1,734 units) was the sole product and demonstrated steady demand comparable to several electronics and accessories products.

Products with high sales volume, such as Monitors and Smartwatches, may benefit from optimized inventory management, while comparing quantity sold with profit can help identify high-margin versus high-volume products.

## Business Implications
* Focus on high-profit products such as Cameras and Monitors to maximize returns

* Maintain strong presence in the West region while addressing volatility in other regions

* Use quantity vs profit analysis to identify high-volume, low-margin products for pricing or cost optimization

* Explore growth opportunities in the Office category, which shows upward potential despite lower overall sales

## Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates how Python-based data analysis and visualization can be used to identify sales trends, regional performance, and product-level profitability. The insights derived can support data-driven decision-making related to inventory management, pricing strategies, and regional expansion.
